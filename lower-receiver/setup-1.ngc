;
; This program does part of the milling of an AR-15 lower receiver.
;
; It is based on the information in chapter 2 of "Machining the AR15 Lower
; Receiver Forging" by Ray Brandes, available from from Ray-Vin.com.
;
; The deck and the recoil buffer mount are finished.
;
; The receiver forging is clamped to the table using the passenger side
; fixture plate.  The deck is parallel to the X axis.  The recoil buffer is
; on the left [negative X direction], and the pivot pin hole [not yet
; drilled] is on the right (positive X direction).
;
; The magazine catch boss is used for locating: the center of the boss is
; X=-2.109, Y=0.563.  This places the pivot pin hole (not yet drilled) at
; X=0, Y=0.
