;
; This program does part of the milling of an AR-15 lower receiver.
;
; It is based on the information in chapter 2 of "Machining the AR15 Lower
; Receiver Forging" by Ray Brandes, available from from Ray-Vin.com.
;
; The bottoms of the trigger guard bosses are finished, and a clamping flat
; is cut into the mag well.  The mag well clamping flat is on part of the
; casting that will later be removed, it is a temporary aid for setup only.
;
; The receiver forging is held in the vise, clamped between the driver's
; side and passenger side fixture plates.  The deck of the casting rests on
; the bed of the vise.  [The fixture plates have to be modified from the
; drawings in chapter 14 for this to work.]  The butt face of the buffer
; mount sticks out the left side [-X side] of the vise and is located by a
; work stop [probably a 1-2-3 block clamped to the table].
;
; This setup makes it quick and convenient to perform the same cut on
; several castings one after the other: no setup measurements needed.
;
; The butt face is at X=0, the casting is centered on the Y=0 line, and the
; deck is at Z=-2.593.  This places the surface that we're going to mill
; the trigger guard bosses to at Z=0.
;
; The trigger guard rear boss starts at X=2.100 and ends at X=2.775
; The Y extent of the rear boss casting is .660
;
; The trigger guard front boss starts at X=4.140 and ends at X=5.050
; The Y extent of the front boss casting is 1.325.
