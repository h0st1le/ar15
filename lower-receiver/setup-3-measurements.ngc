;
; This program does part of the milling of an AR-15 lower receiver.
;
; It is based on chapter 3 of "Machining the AR15 Lower Receiver Forging"
; by Ray Brandes (available from from Ray-Vin.com), and on the drawing
; titled "AR15 LOWER RECEIVER", drawn by D. Snider, released 2000 July 27.
;
; This program uses a plunger-style dial indicator mounted in the spindle
; to make measurements of the Z levels of 6 features on the driver's side
; of the forging:
;
;     1.  top of the bolt release bump
;
;     2.  bolt release bump base surface
;
;     3.  top of mag release bump
;
;     4.  mag release bump base surface
;
;     5.  safety bump base surface
;
;     6.  top of the pistol grip mount surface
;
; The work holding is identical to what's described in setup-3.ngc.
;
; The work offsets will be different:
; 
;     If your plunger is not concentric with the spindle you'll need
;     different X and Y work offsets, so that when the machine is at X0 Y0,
;     the plunger is over the center of the pivot pin hole.
;
;     Set the Z offset by positioning the plunger over the bolt release
;     knob and lowering the spindle until the dial indicator reads .500.
;     Set Z=-0.500 at this level.
;
; Run this program and use the information it produces to set the six Z
; levels at the top of the setup-3.ngc program.
