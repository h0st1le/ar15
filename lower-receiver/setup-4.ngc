;
; This program does part of the milling of an AR-15 lower receiver.
;
; It is based on the information in chapter 4 of "Machining the AR15 Lower
; Receiver Forging" by Ray Brandes, available from from Ray-Vin.com.
;
; In this setup we'll drill and ream the holes and mill the pockets on the
; passenger's side.
;
; The receiver forging is held in the vise, clamped on the deck and the
; trigger guard bosses, with the passenger's side up.  The driver's side is
; up off the vise so we can drill and ream through-holes without nicking
; the vise.
;
; The butt face is on the left (-X), at X=-7.500, deck is on the +Y side at
; 0.250.
;
; Tools used:
;
; end mills:  (with cnc we might not need all of these)
;
;     7/16 2-flute (0.4375)
;     3/8 2-flute (.375) (or bigger)
;     5/16 (.3125)
;     1/2" (.500)
;
; drills:
;
;     1/8"
;     some random chamfering bit (drill-mill, center drill, etc)
;     5/64"
